    "The purpose of this analysis is to explore and gain some insight into the video game industry. We have identified the most popular game genre which is the 'Action' genre and the most popular console which is the 'Playstation 2'. We have also found a trend in regional sales which indicates that the 'North American' region is the most demanding region compared to the other regions such as Japan and Europe. Lastly, from our analysis, we have gathered that the most successful publishing company is Nintendo.
